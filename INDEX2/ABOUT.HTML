<h1>ABOUT F1 RACING</H1>
    <P style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial;font-weight: bold;">Formula One, commonly known as F1, is the world’s premier class of open‑wheel, single‑seater automobile racing, organized under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA). The term “Formula” refers to a set of rules to which all participants must conform, ensuring that teams compete under common technical and sporting regulations. The first official F1 World Championship was held in 1950, with the opening race at Silverstone, and since then the sport has grown into a global phenomenon, combining drama, engineering excellence, driver skill, and commercial spectacle.
