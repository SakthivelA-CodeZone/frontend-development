 <P  >Singapore put on another spectacular show over the weekend, with Mercedes’ George Russell charging to a surprise pole position and victory, McLaren sealing successive Teams’ Championships, title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri clashing and much, much more...

Behind the inspired Russell, a strong P2 finish for Max Verstappen and Red Bull continued their recent positive momentum, while Norris’ bold first-lap pass on team mate Piastri led to the Australian’s championship lead being cut once more.
<H1 style="font-size: 37px;" >Russell makes a Singapore statement</H1>
Russell’s weekend started in tricky circumstances when he put it in the barriers a third of the way through Friday’s second practice session and lost some valuable, representative track time – the Briton subsequently apologising to Mercedes.

However, both the driver and the team came back fighting on Saturday to emerge as outside challengers for pole position, despite the typically hot and humid conditions that have worked against their package in recent years.
