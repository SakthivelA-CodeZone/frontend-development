<p class="write">Google's parent company Alphabet will invest $15bn (Â£11.29bn) to build an AI data hub in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state.

The facility, which will be set up in the port city of Visakhapatnam, will be part of Google's global network of AI centres spread across 12 countries.

"It's the largest AI hub that we are going to be investing in anywhere in the world, outside of the United States," Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, said at an event in the capital Delhi on Tuesday, adding that the investment will be spread over the next five years.

The announcement comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has been asking American companies to prioritise domestic investment.</p>
